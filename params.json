Download the `check` script inside the `bin` directory of this repo\r\n1. Move the `check` script into your `chef-repo`\r\n1. Execute the script from a terminal from within your chef-repo:\r\n\r\n        $ /opt/chef/embedded/bin/ruby check\r\n\r\n    If you are using Windows, your path is slightly different:\r\n\r\n        $ C:/opscode/chef/embedded/bin/ruby.exe check\r\n\r\nThis will test some common endpoints when working with Chef, such as:\r\n\r\n- Connecting to GitHub\r\n- Connecting to a Chef Server\r\n- Downloading a Cookbook\r\n- Establishing an SSH connection\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n1.
